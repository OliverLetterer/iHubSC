V1.7
- to create an issue, check if user is a collaborator and can attach assignee and milestone
- Some kind of icons for folders and filetypes when browsing source trees would be nice. (currently none)
- No access to Wiki pages.
- Basically, you can access almost everything (but no wikis is a big deal!), but it's kind of clunky to do so. This app shows promise, but right now I would recommend against buying it. Keep your eye on this one, however, because if the developer gets active and improves the UI this could be amazing some day.
- syntax highlighting
- webview for diffs (red/green)

Future Features:
- Network graph for recent activity (see Network API)
- ipad Interface

Old APIv2 Calls:
- search for a user
- view commits in a pull request
